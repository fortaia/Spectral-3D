OPEN QUESTIONS:

1- When I make averages in the Spectral sp. should I use the whole field or only what's inside the sphere?? CUBEvs SPHERE

2- Spherical average I am using the number of point within a shell instead of the shell area. Probably not correct??

3 - in cfl routine why? Calculate local MAX : why not * 1/3 ZZZZ

4- truncating the tnl only...does it make sense? Probably not..

5- Discrepancies between dissipation rate in physical and spectral space. Similar values (and discrepancies exist in the
original code)

6- forcing at 0 is 0, right?

7- When enforcing continuity, why do we distribute the continuity residuals according to the wavenumbers?

8- In the original code when computing wavenumbers the highest wavenumber is set to 0 in for each direction (k1,k2,k3).
Book of Quateroni, Canuto, Zang.. mentions stability as it must be real and spurious oscillations in the imaginary part
seems to lead to instability. Does it make sense?
