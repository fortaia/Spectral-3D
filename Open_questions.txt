OPEN QUESTIONS:
1- When I make averages should I use the whole field or only what's inside the sphere?? CUBEvs SPHERE

2- Spherical average I am using the number of point within a shell instead of the shell area. Probably not correct but I'll refine it in the future.

3 - in cfl routine why? Calculate local MAX : why not * 1/3 ZZZZ

4- truncating the tnl only...does it make sense?

5- Discrepancies between mean kin. En. in physical and spectral space due to point 2 probably. Looked briefly into the 2decomp code and seen that it uses a flagave..
