OPEN QUESTIONS:

1- When I make averages in the Spectral sp. should I use the whole field or only what's inside the sphere?? CUBEvs SPHERE

2- Spherical average I am using the number of point within a shell instead of the shell area. Probably not correct but I'll refine it in the future.

3 - in cfl routine why? Calculate local MAX : why not * 1/3 ZZZZ

4- truncating the tnl only...does it make sense?

5- Discrepancies between mean kin. En. in physical and spectral space due to point 2 probably. Looked briefly into the 2decomp code and seen that it uses a flagave..

6- forcing at 0 is 0, right?

7- When enforcing continuity, why do we distribute the continuity residuals according to the wavenumbers?

8- In the original code when computing wavenumbers the highest wavenumber is set to 0 in for each direction (k1,k2,k3).
Book of Quateroni, Canuto, Zang.. mentions stability as it must be real and spurious oscillations in the imaginary part
seems to lead to instability. Does it make sense?
